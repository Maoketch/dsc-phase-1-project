## Conclusion

Below are my findings from my alaysis above;

  1.The production budget plays a major role for  profitabitty in the film industries  . this may be attributed to major factors like  maketing marketing cost, investing investing i popular movie actors and directors  which come at a higher cost, lunguage intepretation of the original film etc.b
  
  2.Horror movies are the most proftable in th film industry  but we have noted that movies that falls under more than one genre are more profitable too.
  
  3.Popularity of a film doesn't guarantee the profitabilty of the film. From our analysis, there are some genres that were very popular in terms of votecounts but the profitabilty was lightly lower.
  
  4. We also noted that astrong positive correlation between domestic_gross and qorldwide_gross. this means that is a movie dose well in the local market, it will also perform well in the international market.
  

## Recomendations

2.Divesify the genres to muximise profitability.In as much as horror movies are the most profitable, we have seen other film that have a mixute of different genres being proftable too.
  
3.The runtime minutes for films is averagely between 90 - 150 minutes, therefore if there's a probability of having a longer film, it's best to create them in series of between 90 - 150 minutes.
  
  
 4.Forcus on marketing the films in the  domestic market as this will determine the sucess/ profitability  of the film in the internatinal markets.As noted in our analysis, there was a strong positive correaltinship between domestic_gross and wolrwide _gross
  
  
  5.. Consider the overall market trend and consumer preferences when making investment decisions in the movie industry.
